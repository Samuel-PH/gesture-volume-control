Gesture Volume Control
A Python-based computer vision tool that allows you to control your system volume using hand gestures via webcam.

⚙️ How it Works
Thumb + Index Pinch: Lower/Raise master volume based on the distance between fingertips.
Visual Feedback: Shows real-time tracking, a connecting line between fingers, and current FPS.

👏 Credits
This project was built following the Computer Vision and AI tutorials provided by Murtaza's Workshop, with updated syntax for modern Pycaw volume control integration.
